3.1	Introduction
3.1.1	Background
Welcome to the Mopedi Store User Manual. This guide will help you navigate and utilize the features of the Mopedi Store efficiently. Mopedi Store is an online platform designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers looking for high-quality and stylish shoes. This user manual aims to guide users and administrators on how to navigate and manage the Mopedi Store efficiently.
3.1.2	About this website
Mopedi Store is developed using a combination of robust technologies to ensure performance, security, and user-friendly interfaces. The website is built with PHP for server-side scripting and MySQL for database management, (CloudDevs, 2019). The frontend utilizes HTML, CSS (Amazon.co.za, 2024), and JavaScript, enhanced with the jQuery library for interactive elements, (js.foundation, 2016). Bootstrap is used for responsive design, ensuring the website is accessible on various devices, (Mark Otto, 2023). Additionally, AJAX is implemented for asynchronous data loading, providing a smooth user experience without the need for constant page refreshes, (developer.mozilla.org, 2016).
3.2	Basics: Accessing your website and Admin
3.2.1	Accessing the website

Admin Access: Administrators can access the admin area by visiting Mopedi Admin URL. Admin login credentials are required to access this section.

3.2.2	The Admin Area
The Admin Area is a backend interface where administrators manage various aspects of the store, including product inventory, orders, customer information, and website content. This area features dashboards, reports, and tools to facilitate efficient store management. Below is an image of the Admin Dashboard:
